# Forms & Clauses Compliance Audit (Post-Update)

_Date: 2025-03-18_

## Executive summary
- **Overall status**: Core datasets now embed effective dates, source URLs, and brokerage guidance, and UI components render those fields consistently. Platform risk drops to **medium** pending automated guardrails and jurisdiction-aware toggles.【F:app.js†L129-L215】【F:app.js†L887-L940】
- **Key gains**:
  1. Search, lists, and exports hydrate from the same governed schema, eliminating drift between discovery and rendered packages.【F:app.js†L35-L118】【F:app.js†L887-L940】【F:app.js†L1314-L1363】
  2. Transaction bundles now include Windsor-Essex disclosures (e.g., ERCA, short-term rental licences) with clear Jump Realty requirements and notes.【F:app.js†L219-L320】【F:app.js†L1073-L1126】
  3. Clause records include provenance metadata and use the async Clipboard API with graceful fallback to avoid silent copy failures.【F:app.js†L521-L590】【F:app.js†L1268-L1294】
- **Residual blockers**: Governance still lives inline in `app.js`, tests do not assert dataset integrity, and municipal logic is driven by property-type heuristics instead of geo-coded inputs.【F:app.js†L35-L320】【F:app.js†L1073-L1126】【F:app.js†L1184-L1237】

## Update highlights
### Governed datasets & search parity
- Universal and rental inventories now track effective dates, compliance bases, and Jump Realty notes so advisors can see why each document exists and when it was last refreshed.【F:app.js†L129-L320】
- `initializeSearchData` flattens the same canonical objects used for rendering, ensuring search results, checklists, and exports stay synchronized as metadata evolves.【F:app.js†L35-L118】

### Transaction bundles aligned with Windsor requirements
- Each property bundle promotes a structured primary form plus supporting artefacts, flagging Jump Realty requirements such as ERCA/septic disclosures, Windsor student housing licences, and STR permits.【F:app.js†L219-L320】
- Result generation surfaces official numbers, effective dates, and brokerage obligations so agents cannot miss mandatory add-ons during packaging.【F:app.js†L1073-L1126】

### Clause governance & tooling
- Clauses now carry status, effective dates, and source links, giving auditors traceability to OREA and RTA references.【F:app.js†L521-L590】
- Copy operations first use the modern Clipboard API and fall back with logging, preventing silent failures on locked-down browsers.【F:app.js†L1268-L1294】
- Exports include numbering, effective dates, compliance anchors, and Jump Realty notes, so off-platform sharing retains context.【F:app.js†L1314-L1363】

### Checklist modernization
- Compliance checklist messaging distinguishes between universal prerequisites and property-type specifics (e.g., Windsor STR licence uploads, student conduct acknowledgements).【F:app.js†L1184-L1237】

## Outstanding work
1. **Externalize datasets**: Move form and clause JSON into `/src/data` with schema validation so governance edits do not require redeploying `app.js`. Introduce checksum logging to detect out-of-band modifications.【F:app.js†L35-L320】
2. **Automated assurance**: Extend Jest suites to verify that deprecated artefacts (e.g., SPIS) never surface, Jump Realty requirements appear for relevant property types, and exports include provenance tags.【F:app.js†L219-L320】【F:app.js†L1314-L1363】
3. **Jurisdiction-aware logic**: Replace property-type heuristics with location inputs and municipal registries (e.g., Windsor By-law 135-2022) to toggle licensing artefacts based on actual property address.【F:app.js†L219-L320】【F:app.js†L1184-L1237】
4. **Runtime telemetry**: Add console warnings/UI badges when forms lack `effectiveDate` or `sourceUrl` metadata to catch regressions during authoring.【F:app.js†L129-L215】

## Next steps
- Stand up a lightweight governance dashboard that consumes the centralized JSON, exposes diff history, and runs scheduled checks against RECO/OREA bulletins and Jump Realty memos.【F:app.js†L35-L215】
- Document SOPs for quarterly AML risk matrix updates and municipal licence audits, embedding reminders into existing toast/notification flows.【F:app.js†L129-L215】【F:app.js†L1184-L1237】
- Re-run this audit after externalizing data and adding automated tests to validate that new safeguards prevent reintroduction of deprecated documents.
