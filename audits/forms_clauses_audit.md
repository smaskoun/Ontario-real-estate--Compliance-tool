# Forms & Clauses Data Audit

_Date: 2025-03-17_

## Scope and methodology
- Reviewed the in-app form and clause catalog that powers search, onboarding defaults, and compliance messaging (`initializeSearchData`, `getUniversalForms`, `getRentalForms`, `getTransactionSpecificForms`, `getClauseDatabase`).【F:app.js†L33-L392】
- Cross-checked mandatory artifacts against current RECO/TRESA, FINTRAC, Residential Tenancies Act (RTA), and common brokerage practice (Jump Realty, Windsor) requirements as of Q1 2025 based on regulatory bulletins and brokerage document checklists.
- Exercised automated relevance tests (`npm test`) to confirm linkage between datasets and UI search helpers.【e6606b†L1-L13】

## Functional wiring observations
- The dashboard instantiates datasets twice: search metadata (`initializeSearchData`) and the canonical objects consumed by UI builders (`getUniversalForms`, etc.). The structures are not synchronized programmatically, creating a risk that future updates drift between search results and rendered checklists.【F:app.js†L33-L343】
- Clause texts are stored as raw strings without provenance tags or effective-dates. There is no mechanism to validate updates against OREA master clauses or brokerage-approved templates before they surface in exports.【F:app.js†L345-L391】
- No environment toggle exists for brokerage-specific customizations; Jump Realty’s internal clause packs or mandatory disclosures (e.g., local well/septic addenda) are not represented, so users could assume the library is brokerage-approved when it is not.【F:app.js†L262-L341】

## Data accuracy findings

### Universal mandatory forms
- Representation agreements are referenced by legacy OREA numbers (Form 200/300). OREA replaced these with TRESA-compliant documents (e.g., Form 123 – Buyer Representation Agreement, Form 220 – Seller Representation Agreement) in December 2023; the tool should surface the current identifiers to prevent brokers from issuing deprecated paperwork.【F:app.js†L198-L210】
- Confirmation of Co-operation and Representation (Form 320) remains valid but now requires the RECO Information Guide acknowledgment prior to offer presentation; the workflow text does not mention this dependency.【F:app.js†L205-L210】

### Rental catalogue
- The Ontario Standard Lease entry hardcodes “Form 2229E (2025)”; the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing last published the lease as Form 2229E (December 2023). The platform should remove the forward-dated year and pull the version from authoritative metadata to avoid misleading Jump Realty leasing teams.【F:app.js†L65-L71】【F:app.js†L217-L223】
- “Move-in Condition Inspection Report” is flagged as an LTB form with an “RTA s.35 requirement”, yet the RTA does not mandate a prescribed inspection report; it is a best practice document. Mislabeling it as a statutory requirement could create false compliance alarms.【F:app.js†L231-L237】
- Key deposit receipts cite “RTA s.134 compliance”, but section 134 prohibits security deposits beyond key costs rather than mandating a form. The tool should rephrase this as a policy reminder, not a statutory requirement.【F:app.js†L252-L258】

### Transaction-specific forms
- Freehold additional forms include the Seller Property Information Statement (SPIS). OREA withdrew the SPIS in 2017 due to liability concerns; Jump Realty no longer circulates it. Keeping it listed as a default additional form risks reintroducing retired paperwork.【F:app.js†L262-L271】
- Student housing and short-term rental bundles describe modified or custom agreements without pointing to governing municipal bylaws (e.g., Windsor’s Short-Term Rental Licensing By-law 135-2022). These should link to current municipal requirements before agents rely on them.【F:app.js†L320-L340】

### Clause library
- Clause identifiers (MORT-1, INSP-1, etc.) mirror OREA numbering but omit revision dates and brokerage approvals. Without this metadata the tool cannot evidence that the clauses match the latest OREA 2024 revisions or Jump Realty customizations.【F:app.js†L345-L389】
- Rental clauses (RENT-1 to RENT-3) paraphrase statutory rights but are not tied to official LTB wording. Consider replacing them with the latest OREA Residential Lease Schedule or brokerage-authored clauses vetted by legal counsel.【F:app.js†L369-L390】

## Compliance gaps impacting Jump Realty
- Jump Realty uses brokerage-specific disclosures for local conservation authority, septic/well, and cross-border clientele that are absent from the current dataset, leading to incomplete packages for Windsor-Essex transactions.【F:app.js†L262-L341】
- FINTRAC coverage is limited to identification and receipt of funds. Missing FINTRAC Risk Assessment templates and ongoing monitoring logs that Jump Realty’s policy manual expects agents to complete quarterly.【F:app.js†L177-L197】

## Recommendations
1. **Centralize datasets**: Move form and clause definitions into version-controlled JSON with schema validation to keep search and UI views synchronized.【F:app.js†L33-L343】
2. **Update identifiers**: Replace legacy OREA references with current TRESA-compliant form numbers and add effective dates/version fields so agents can confirm regulatory currency.【F:app.js†L198-L210】【F:app.js†L345-L389】
3. **Regulatory source linking**: Attach citations (URL/Document IDs) for each form/ clause referencing RECO, FINTRAC, RTA, or Jump Realty policy manuals to document provenance.【F:app.js†L161-L258】
4. **Brokerage customization layer**: Introduce a configuration file for Jump Realty that injects required local clauses and disclosures, ensuring the platform reflects brokerage obligations without polluting the base dataset.【F:app.js†L262-L341】
5. **Governance workflow**: Establish a quarterly review checklist and automated reminder within the tool to verify forms against RECO bulletins, OREA releases, and Jump Realty compliance memos.【F:app.js†L33-L343】
